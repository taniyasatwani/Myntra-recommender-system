## Inspiration
A recommender system seeks to estimate and predict user content preference. The system draws from data usage history, aiming at making suggestions based on the userâ€™s (current) interests.  

Most of the fashion purchases are when done when you see someone using the product and then after you look for the similar product or sometimes maybe the exact one. This thing cannot be achieved by the simple text search and to overcome it, we can use image search. So now whenever you find some interesting fashion, just click the photo of it, and search it using image search option. This will show the top 5 related fashion products which are related to the products in fashion.

## Dataset

## Overview
Get the dataset from `Kaggle`, it contains 44K images of different fashion clothing. 

Model is trained using `Resnet50` with `max pooling layer`. Features are extracted from the images.

`Nearest neighbour` with `euclidean distance` is used to predict top 5 images similar to user's interest. 

Front end is developed using `Streamlit`.
